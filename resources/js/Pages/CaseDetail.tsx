                            UBS aims at providing a best-in-class banking app
                            for their private clients. The client turned to the
                            product design experts at Netguru for support in
                            redesigning the app. The goal was to unify payment
                            flows and to design a seamless mobile experience
                            across all mobile banking app features. The KPIs
                            were to improve ratings in the app stores and
                            accelerate the login process.
